This is the first final project I made for finishing my codedex journey:
"The Legend of Python"
It is a QR code generator and I used it to generate a QR to my instagram page!
*Update
I added user input interface which lets you
- customize the file name
- manually entering the file link
- entering the fill color
- entering the back color
- weather you want to use logo and asks you for its name
